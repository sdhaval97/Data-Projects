# NYC Taxi Data Analysis

## Overview

This repository contains the codebase for an in-depth analysis of the NYC Taxi dataset from September 2015. The project involves various data processing and analytical techniques to extract meaningful insights.

## Technical Insights

### 1. Data Loading Proficiency
Successfully handled a large dataset in the .tar format, consisting of 1.5 million records and 21 features. Leveraged Pandas for efficient data manipulation.

### 2. Haversine Distance Calculation
Implemented the Haversine formula for precise distance computation based on latitude and longitude coordinates. Essential for accurate spatial analysis.

### 3. Histogram Insights
Utilized histograms to identify anomalies in the dataset, enabling effective data cleaning. Addressed challenges related to zero values in coordinate data.

### 4. Effective Data Cleaning
Demonstrated meticulous data cleaning by addressing issues with zero values in coordinate data. Ensured dataset integrity for accurate analysis.

### 5. Temporal Analysis
Extracted hour information from datetime data, facilitating temporal analysis and grouping of data based on time of day.

### 6. Grouping & Aggregation
Applied advanced grouping techniques using Pandas to derive meaningful statistics, revealing patterns and trends within the dataset.

### 7. Hypothesis Testing with Box Plots
Leveraged box plots for hypothesis testing, gaining insights into the distribution of average trip speeds across different hours of the day.
