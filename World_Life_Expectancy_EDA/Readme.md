# Portfolio Project: World Life Expectancy Analysis

## Project Overview

This portfolio project involves analyzing global life expectancy data. The project includes data cleaning, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and deriving insights from the data. The aim is to understand trends, patterns, and factors affecting life expectancy across different countries.

## Files and Directories

- `Data Cleaning.sql`: SQL script for cleaning the raw data.
- `EDA.sql`: SQL script for performing exploratory data analysis on the cleaned data.
- `WorldLifeExpectancy.csv`: The raw dataset containing life expectancy information for various countries.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

To run the SQL scripts, you will need a SQL environment such as MySQL, PostgreSQL, or any other SQL-compatible database management system. Make sure you have the necessary permissions to create databases, tables, and execute scripts.

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/your-repo-name.git
    cd your-repo-name
    ```

2. **Set up the database:**
    - Create a new database in your SQL environment.
    - Import the `WorldLifeExpectancy.csv` into a table named `world_life_expectancy`.

### Data Cleaning

The `Data Cleaning.sql` script cleans the raw data by:
- Removing duplicates
- Handling missing values
- Correcting data types
- Normalizing data

### Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

The `EDA.sql` script performs exploratory data analysis to uncover insights such as:

- Descriptive statistics (mean, median, mode)
- Distribution of life expectancy across countries and regions
- Trends over time
- Correlation with other variables (e.g., GDP, healthcare expenditure)

### Insights and Findings

**Global Trends:**

- Analysis of life expectancy trends over the years.
- Identification of countries with the highest and lowest life expectancies.

**Regional Analysis:**

- Comparison of life expectancy across different regions.
- Examination of factors contributing to regional differences.

**Correlation Analysis:**

- Investigation of the relationship between life expectancy and socioeconomic factors.

### Conclusion

This project provides a comprehensive analysis of global life expectancy data, highlighting important trends and factors influencing life expectancy. The findings can be useful for policymakers, researchers, and healthcare professionals to devise strategies for improving life expectancy worldwide.
