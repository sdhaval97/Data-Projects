# Global Terrorism Analysis Project

## Introduction

This project aims to analyze global terrorism incidents from 1970 through 2017, utilizing the Global Terrorism Database (GTD). The GTD is maintained by the National Consortium for the Study of Terrorism and Responses to Terrorism (START), headquartered at the University of Maryland. It includes data on over 180,000 terrorist attacks worldwide, providing a comprehensive overview of the trends and patterns in terrorism over the last several decades.

## Project Description

The primary objective of this analysis is to understand the distribution and nature of terrorist incidents globally, with a particular focus on the following aspects:

- **Trends Over Time**: How has the number of terrorist activities changed over the years? Are certain regions more affected than others, and how does this compare to global averages?
- **Correlation and Analysis**: Is there a correlation between the number of incidents and the number of casualties? Are there any notable outliers or irregularities in the data?
- **Methods of Attack**: What are the most common methods of attack? How do these vary by region or over time?
- **Visualizations**: To aid in our analysis, we will employ various data visualization techniques, including geographical mapping of incidents and statistical graphs to illustrate trends and patterns.

## Motivation

The motivation behind this project stems from the ongoing global impact of terrorism. By analyzing historical data, we aim to identify patterns and trends that could inform future counterterrorism strategies and policies. Understanding the evolution of terrorism can also help in predicting future trends and preparing more effective responses.

## Tools and Techniques

For this analysis, we will utilize the following tools and techniques:

- **Python**: For data manipulation and analysis, using libraries such as Pandas and NumPy.
- **Visualization Libraries**: Matplotlib and Seaborn for generating statistical charts, and possibly Folium for interactive maps.
- **Statistical Analysis**: To explore correlations and trends

## Conclusion

Upon completion, this project will provide valuable insights into the trends of terrorism globally, supported by data-driven analyses and visualizations. The findings could potentially aid policymakers, security professionals, and academic researchers in understanding and combating the threats posed by terrorism.
